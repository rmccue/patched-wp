# WordPress (Patched)

This is WordPress core, synched to upstream releases, with custom patches that I
find useful.

Tickets are used for tracking integration status. Once an existing patch has
been integrated into WordPress core, the commit here can be reverted.

Ideally, this would always be stock-standard WordPress, but patches take time to
get integrated, and there are features I need now.

Note that rebasing will be used liberally, so pulling may not always be clean.
